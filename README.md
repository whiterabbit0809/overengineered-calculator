# Over-engineered Calculator (Go)

Backend project in Go for an "over-engineered" calculator service.

The goal of the project is to build a small but realistic backend system with:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable business logic
- REST API
- Dockerized deployment
- microservice-friendly structure, auth, and a small web UI

_Current status: auth service + basic web UI are implemented. Calculator and history will be added on top of this architecture._
